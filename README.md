What We Are Building

Our goal in the workshop is to build a simple application that navigates between two routes /blue and /red. Each will render a simple component with the background being that specific color. It will be something like this:

View of workshop, a header with three links, blue, red and home, with a page with the respective color displayed behind it

We will utilize the components from React Router to build out our functionality. There are no hooks for this workshop.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
